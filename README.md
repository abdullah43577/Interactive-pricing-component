## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Library/Framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use Tailwind CSS. It's my first time using it. I felt very slow building this simple website, but with time and practice I'll get the hang of it.

### Continued development

I'll continue working my way up to becoming better using this CSS framework [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a very useful library I hope I can flow with it pretty soon.


### Useful resources
